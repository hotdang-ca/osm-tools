OpenStreetMap Parser
A couple of scripts for parsing OpenStreetMap .osm.pbf files, to extract the amenities contained within.

Requirements
You will need at least the JAVA_JRE, properly installed and in your path. Check with:

$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/path/to/jdk1.8.0_111.jdk/Contents/Home


You also need osmosis to do the heavy lifting of converting binary .pbf files to extracted XML. Osmosis can be found here .

HOWTO
Step 1: Extract
The ./extract.sh file can be made +x:

chmod +x ./extract.sh


Then, perform the parsing with the following format:

extract.sh <filename>.osm.pbf <location> <amenity>


Ex:

extract.sh manitoba-latest.osm.pbf Manitoba restaurant


Youâ€™ll then receive a <location>-<amenity>-all.osm file!

Step 2: Parse
The included ./parse.py can also be made +x:

chmod +x ./parse.py


Then, perform the parsing with the following format:

parse.py <filename>.osm


Eg:

parse.py Manitoba-restaurant-all.opm


The parse.py file currently lists all Nodes effectively; extracting name, latitude, and longitude coordinates. Still working on Way types; we can, at least, list their names.

TODO:
* Extracting WAY nd values and getting their coordinates.
* Error handling
